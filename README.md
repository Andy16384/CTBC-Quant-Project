Here are some projects that I have complete during the internship in CTBC Quant team.
Most are coding tasks in C++ and VBA.
With utilizing .dll function of C++, we can accelerate the calculations.

Tasks including:
- Bootstrapping Yield Curve
- Interpolating the Volatility Surface
- Caliberating some model to the market
- Simulating some price process
